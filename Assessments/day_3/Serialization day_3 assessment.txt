Serialization

definition: Serialization means converting data (like a Python object) into a format that can be saved to a 
	    file or sent over the internet, and then later restored back (deserialization) to its original form.

example: 

-> Packing your data into a box (serialization)

-> Sending or saving the box

-> Unpacking it later when you need it again (deserialization)

>> Serialization = turn object -> storable format

>> Deserialization = turn stored data -> original object
